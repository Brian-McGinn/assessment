# RAG explained

# Scenario

You need to explain the value of a RAG pipeline to a non-technical customer.

# Task

Write a 300–400 word email explaining:
What a RAG pipeline is.
Why it helps reduce hallucinations.
What changes they may need to make to their current data systems.
Avoid jargon unless explained clearly.

Hello Crowdbotic Customer,

I wanted to follow up on our earlier conversation about Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and help explain the ways it will strengthen your use case. 

Your current system uses an AI to answer questions. Just like a person the AI can forget details and will fill in the blanks with information that sounds plausible but is not accurate. This is what we call a "hallucination". RAG is a way to help the AI look up the missing information similar to someone searching the internet.

To enable RAG some changes to how you organize and store your data will be required. The key step is preparing your data so it is searchable. This process involves storing your documents in a format that allows the AI to quickly retrieve specific passages. In practice this involves setting up a specialized database for documents (oftern called a "vector database") or indexing your existing content in a way that supports efficient lookups. In some cases you may be required to clean or restructure your data to ensure consistency.

The good news is that these changes build long-term value. Once your data is prepared for RAG, it can be reused across multiple AI solutions. This foundation allows your organization to confidently scale AI use cases while ensuring accuracy and trust.

Please let me know if you’d like to see a simple demo of how RAG works in practice—I think it will make the benefits even clearer.

Best regards,
Brian McGinn






Hello [Customer Name],

I wanted to follow up on our recent conversation and explain the value of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline in a way that connects directly to your use case.

At a high level, a RAG pipeline is a method for combining two things: the reasoning power of modern AI models and the reliability of your own trusted data. Instead of relying on the AI to “remember” information it was trained on, RAG allows the system to actively look up facts from your documents, databases, or knowledge bases in real time. The AI then uses this retrieved information when generating an answer.

This approach directly addresses a common issue called “hallucination,” where AI makes up details that sound plausible but are not accurate. With RAG, the AI’s responses are anchored in your actual data, meaning summaries, insights, and recommendations are supported by evidence. For example, if your AI assistant is asked about obligations in a contract, it will pull the exact language from the contract before creating its explanation. That way, you can always trace answers back to the source.

To enable RAG, you may need to make some modest changes to your current data systems. The most important step is preparing your data so it is searchable. This usually means storing your documents in a format that allows the AI to quickly retrieve specific passages. In practice, this could involve setting up a specialized database for documents (often called a “vector database”) or indexing your existing content in a way that supports efficient lookups. In some cases, it may also involve cleaning or restructuring your data to ensure consistency.

The good news is that these changes build long-term value. Once your data is prepared for RAG, it can be reused across multiple AI solutions, not just contract summarization. This foundation allows your organization to confidently scale AI use cases while ensuring accuracy and trust.

A typical Large Language Model (LLM), like ChatGPT, is trained on an enormous amount of general data. Because of this, it develops broad knowledge across many topics, but it is rarely an expert in any one domain. For tasks such as editing an email or summarizing a website, this general knowledge is usually more than enough.

However, when you want an LLM to perform a specialized task that requires deep domain expertise, the model’s general training will fall short. This is where Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) comes in.

RAG provides an LLM with access to a trusted set of documents or knowledge sources that contain the domain-specific information it needs. Instead of relying on what it learned during training, the model retrieves relevant content from these sources in real time and incorporates that information into its response.

A useful analogy is how a doctor approaches a difficult case. A doctor has broad medical training, but when faced with a complex diagnosis, they often consult the latest research studies or reach out to specialists. In the same way, an LLM using RAG can “consult” the right documents to give a well-informed and accurate answer.

This capability is especially valuable in fields that evolve quickly, where having the most up-to-date information is essential. In healthcare, for example, using outdated knowledge could lead to poor diagnoses and even patient harm. By leveraging RAG, the AI can always ground its recommendations in the latest, most relevant information available.
