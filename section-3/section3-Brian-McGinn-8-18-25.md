# RAG explained

# Scenario

You need to explain the value of a RAG pipeline to a non-technical customer.

# Task

Write a 300–400 word email explaining:
What a RAG pipeline is.
Why it helps reduce hallucinations.
What changes they may need to make to their current data systems.
Avoid jargon unless explained clearly.

Hello Crowdbotic Customer,

I wanted to follow up on our recent conversation on how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can benefit your system.

Traditional AI systems are trained on large sets of information, but that information can quickly become outdated or may not cover the specific details you care about. For example, if you ask an AI about a recent event or something unique to your company, it might not know the answer or could even make up a response that sounds right but isn’t accurate. This is known as a “hallucination,” and it’s a common challenge with AI.

RAG helps solve this problem by allowing the AI to search for relavant data, in real time, and use that information to answer questions. Instead of guessing, the AI can pull up the exact details from your files, policies, or records, making its answers more reliable and easier to verify.

To enable RAG, you may need to make some modest changes to your current data systems. The most important step is preparing your data so it is searchable. This usually means storing your documents in a format that allows the AI to quickly retrieve specific passages. In practice, this could involve setting up a specialized database for documents (often called a “vector database”) or indexing your existing content in a way that supports efficient lookups. In some cases, it may also involve cleaning or restructuring your data to ensure consistency.

The effort to prepare your data for RAG pays off in the long run. Once set up, your information can be used by many different AI tools, helping you get accurate, trustworthy answers across a range of tasks.

If you’d like, I can show you a simple demo of how RAG works in practice. I think seeing it in action will make the benefits even clearer.

Best regards,
