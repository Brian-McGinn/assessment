Hello Crowdbotic Customer,

I wanted to follow up on our recent conversation and explain, in simple terms, how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can benefit your work.

Traditional AI systems are trained on large sets of information, but that information can quickly become outdated or may not cover the specific details you care about. For example, if you ask an AI about a recent event or something unique to your company, it might not know the answer or could even make up a response that sounds right but isn’t accurate. This is known as a “hallucination,” and it’s a common challenge with AI.

RAG helps solve this problem by allowing the AI to search your own documents and data in real time, and use that information to answer questions. Instead of guessing, the AI can pull up the exact details from your files, policies, or records, making its answers more reliable and easier to verify.

To make RAG work, you may need to organize your data so it’s easy for the AI to search. This usually means storing documents in a way that allows quick lookups—sometimes using a special type of database called a “vector database,” or by indexing your existing files. You might also need to tidy up or standardize your data so the AI can find what it needs without confusion.

The effort to prepare your data for RAG pays off in the long run. Once set up, your information can be used by many different AI tools, helping you get accurate, trustworthy answers across a range of tasks.

If you’d like, I can show you a simple demo of how RAG works in practice. I think seeing it in action will make the benefits even clearer.

Best regards,

Hello [Customer Name],

I wanted to follow up on our recent conversation and explain the value of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline in a way that connects directly to your use case.

At a high level, a RAG pipeline is a method for combining two things: the reasoning power of modern AI models and the reliability of your own trusted data. Instead of relying on the AI to “remember” information it was trained on, RAG allows the system to actively look up facts from your documents, databases, or knowledge bases in real time. The AI then uses this retrieved information when generating an answer.

This approach directly addresses a common issue called “hallucination,” where AI makes up details that sound plausible but are not accurate. With RAG, the AI’s responses are anchored in your actual data, meaning summaries, insights, and recommendations are supported by evidence. For example, if your AI assistant is asked about obligations in a contract, it will pull the exact language from the contract before creating its explanation. That way, you can always trace answers back to the source.

To enable RAG, you may need to make some modest changes to your current data systems. The most important step is preparing your data so it is searchable. This usually means storing your documents in a format that allows the AI to quickly retrieve specific passages. In practice, this could involve setting up a specialized database for documents (often called a “vector database”) or indexing your existing content in a way that supports efficient lookups. In some cases, it may also involve cleaning or restructuring your data to ensure consistency.

The good news is that these changes build long-term value. Once your data is prepared for RAG, it can be reused across multiple AI solutions, not just contract summarization. This foundation allows your organization to confidently scale AI use cases while ensuring accuracy and trust.

Please let me know if you’d like to see a simple demo of how RAG works in practice—I think it will make the benefits even clearer.

A typical Large Language Model (LLM), like ChatGPT, is trained on an enormous amount of general data. Because of this, it develops broad knowledge across many topics, but it is rarely an expert in any one domain. For tasks such as editing an email or summarizing a website, this general knowledge is usually more than enough.

However, when you want an LLM to perform a specialized task that requires deep domain expertise, the model’s general training will fall short. This is where Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) comes in.

RAG provides an LLM with access to a trusted set of documents or knowledge sources that contain the domain-specific information it needs. Instead of relying on what it learned during training, the model retrieves relevant content from these sources in real time and incorporates that information into its response.

A useful analogy is how a doctor approaches a difficult case. A doctor has broad medical training, but when faced with a complex diagnosis, they often consult the latest research studies or reach out to specialists. In the same way, an LLM using RAG can “consult” the right documents to give a well-informed and accurate answer.

This capability is especially valuable in fields that evolve quickly, where having the most up-to-date information is essential. In healthcare, for example, using outdated knowledge could lead to poor diagnoses and even patient harm. By leveraging RAG, the AI can always ground its recommendations in the latest, most relevant information available.
